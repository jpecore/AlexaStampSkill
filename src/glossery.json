Most catalogs say whether they price CTO stamps or genuinely used stamps.\""

      "Cut cancellation": {
      "def": ": A cancellation that intentionally slices into the stamp paper. Often a wedge-shaped section is cut away.

   },

      "Die": {
      "def": ": The original engraving of a stamp design, usually recess-engraved in reverse on a small flat piece of soft steel.

   },

      "Die cut": {
      "def": ": A form of separation usually employed on self-adhesive stamps.

   },

      "Duplicate": {
      "def": ": An additional copy of a stamp that one already has in a collection. Beginners often consider stamps to be duplicates that really are not, because they overlook perforation, watermark or color varieties."
